# Unit-2-Challenge
## Homework assignment for Unit 2: Advanced CSS

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- created a portfolio page with navigation links, a photo of myself, a bio, recent projects (which will be populated as we go through the course), and contact info
- added alt text to all images within the web page
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading
